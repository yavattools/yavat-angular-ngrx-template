Status: able to integrate with API. 
here are few observations which needs to discuss.

1. Login API is working and need some details about how to use
  - Menu List.
2. Agencies Master List is able to connect and getting 27k Records.
  - The fields what we are getting are very few and not matching to the 
    API contract document which shared earlier. 
  - thse are not having many of the table columns data.
  
3. Escrow apis are expecting Escrow ID, but not able to find it in Agency Master data.
4. Need other API details.
